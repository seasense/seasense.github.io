	<h3>Can the American-led Black Lives Matter movement trigger an African awakening?</h3>
	<p>A good friend of mine shared this story with me. When her daughter was seven, she told her mother in no uncertain terms that she didn't want any black kids at her own birthday party. My friend was shocked not just because her daughter was black -- so was she -- but because her daughter felt that black people were not the kind of people she wanted at her party.</p>
	<p>My friend, like any black mother, was alarmed. She couldn't figure out how her child got to that point in her thinking. After taking a moment, she responded, "Well, if you are going to insist on not having any black people at your party then technically that means you can't come to your own party, and neither can your other friends, your brother and your dad." Her daughter paused, weighed up the pros and cons and responded a little reluctantly with; "OK, I guess we can invite everyone then."</p>
